= Everything-as-code. A polyglot experiment.

As modern, agile developers we love to master several different languages all at once to be 100% productive.
We define our development environments using Gradle. We implement our software in Java, Kotlin or another JVM
based language. We use Groovy or Scala to test our code at different layers. We construct the build pipelines
for our software using a Groovy DSL or JSON. We use YAML and Python to describe the infrastructure and the
deployment for our applications. We document our architectures using AsciiDoc and JRuby. Welcome to Babel!
Making the right choice in this multitude of available languages is not easy. This polyglot example project is
a highly opinionated journey into the modern era of software industrialization.

== SEU-as-code

This project uses SEU-as-code to build the software development environment for this project using Gradle. The definition
is contained in the `build.seu` build file. To bootstrap the SEU, you need to issue the following command:
```bash
$ ./gradlew -b build.seu bootstrapSeu
```

== Build-as-code

== Main-as-code

== Test-as-code

This project uses Groovy and Spock for Unit and Integration testing, and Scala with Gatling for Performance testing.
Spock is JUnit, Hamcrest and Mockito on steroids. Plus a super slick Groovy based DSL. Writing tests like this is fun.
Also the integration with other well-known frameworks such as RestAssured is very easy and expressive with Spock.

For a total change we use Scale and Gatling as a framework to implement the load tests for this project. Gatling has an
expressive DSL, any kind of load test can be expressed easily, not matter if it is a REST-stype project or a JSF-based
UI project.

== Presentation-as-code

The slides for the initial JaavOne presentation are written in Markdown. There are several rendering alternatives available.
Or if you are a JavaScript fan you can use Reveal.js as a framework to program your slides.

- This is for real programmers! :smiley:
- Several open source projects available
