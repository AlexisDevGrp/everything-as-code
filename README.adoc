http://= Everything-as-code. A polyglot experiment.

As modern, agile developers we love to master several different languages all at once to be 100% productive.
We define our development environments using Gradle. We implement our software in Java, Kotlin or another JVM
based language. We use Groovy or Scala to test our code at different layers. We construct the build pipelines
for our software using a Groovy DSL or JSON. We use YAML and Python to describe the infrastructure and the
deployment for our applications. We document our architectures using AsciiDoc and JRuby. Welcome to Babel!
Making the right choice in this multitude of available languages is not easy. This polyglot example project is
a highly opinionated journey into the modern era of software industrialization.
